### DuckDuckGoogle

Don't want to use google? Well maybe you want to use google occasionally when DuckDuckGo doesn't match that awful 4 page long error code your bad programming spits out? DuckDuckGoogle adds a simple button to DuckDuckGo to search in Google on the fly. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone.

To install manually:

1) Clone this repo
2) Go to chrome://extensions/.
3) At the top right, turn on Developer mode.
4) Click Load unpacked.
5) Find and select the app or extension folder.
